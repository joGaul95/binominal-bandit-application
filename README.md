This repo corresponds to the paper: How to Cold Call Firms? An Application of Multi-Armed Bandit Optimization in Corporate Web Surveys, by Johannes Gaul, Thomas Simon, Davud Rostam-Afschar.

The code implemented is a python implementation of the R-package provided originally by Lotze and Loecher (2014). The code they provide was established by Scott (2010). It is also used as an example for a Multi-Armed Bandid Application in Kaibel and Biemann (2021).
